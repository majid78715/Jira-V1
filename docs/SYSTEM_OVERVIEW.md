# System Overview

Phase 0 establishes the baseline Next.js + Express + JSON datastore architecture.  
Phase 1 layered on JWT/cookie auth, SUPER_ADMIN admin surfaces, and RBAC-protected user/company CRUD.  
Phase 2 now enables end-to-end vendor onboarding: invitations (PM → Project Manager → Developer), accept-invite with full profiles, PM approvals, and profile-change requests so VM/Dev users stay compliant with the required profile fields (mobile/country/city/timeZone/title).  
Phase 3 introduces project/task tracking and the assignment workflow so PMs can budget work, project managers can scope tasks, and developers see their My Tasks queue after approvals.  
Phase 4 brings the configurable task estimation workflow, workflow-definition CRUD, PM start-date scheduling, and expected completion calculations that honor working schedules, holidays, and day offs.  
Phase 5 adds personal work schedules, company holiday management, and day off requests/approvals so every downstream timeline reflects up-to-date availability data.
Phase 6 completes the developer view with attendance clock in/out, schedule-aware aggregates, and task-linked manual time entries surfaced on the Today panel.
